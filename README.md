# Technical-Documentation

# Overview:

This project is a Technical Documentation Page designed to present information about web development fundamentals in a clean, structured, and responsive format. The page is implemented using HTML, CSS, and adheres to modern web design practices, including accessibility and responsiveness.

## Key Features:

### 1. Navigation Sidebar:

- A fixed navigation bar on the left (or top for smaller screens) enables smooth navigation between different sections of the document.

- The sidebar contains links to five main sections:

- HTML Basics
- CSS Fundamentals
- JavaScript Introduction
- Responsive Design
- Web Development Tools

- The active section is visually highlighted for ease of use.

### 2. Responsive Design:

- The layout adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes using media queries.
- For smaller screens, the sidebar converts into a horizontal navigation bar for better usability.

### 3. Content Organization:

- The content is divided into well-defined sections, each encapsulated - in its own <section> element.
- Each section has a clear header and structured paragraphs, lists, and code snippets.

### 4. Styling:

- Uses a clean and modern design with CSS variables for easy customization of colors and spacing.

- Features include:

- A light background with contrasting text for readability.
- Hover effects and transitions on navigation links and sections to enhance interactivity.
- Shadow effects and subtle animations to add depth.

### 5. Code Snippets:

- Code examples are presented using the <code> element with custom styling to distinguish them from regular text.
- Syntax highlighting is achieved using a styled background and borders.

### 6. Smooth Scrolling:

- The page utilizes the scroll-behavior: smooth property for a seamless user experience when navigating via anchor links.

### 7. Accessibility:

- The page uses semantic HTML elements to improve accessibility for screen readers.
- Large and clear fonts are used to enhance readability.

### 8. Custom Scrollbar:

A styled scrollbar is included for modern browsers to enhance the visual consistency of the interface.
